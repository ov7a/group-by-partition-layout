The only goal of this layout is to simply group graph's partitions (obtained, for example,  by some clustering algorithm) and visualize them separated.

Big thanks to Jaroslav Kuchar and his [Layered Layout plugin](https://github.com/jaroslav-kuchar/Layered-Layout), I used some ideas from his code.
